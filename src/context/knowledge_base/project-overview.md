# Brandon's Projects

Brandon has worked on 4 main AI and multi-agent system projects:

## 1. Wordle Multi-Agent Bot
**Date:** Jan 2026
**Type:** Personal Project
**Summary:** A 4-agent system using Google Agent Development Kit that autonomously plays Wordle online, solving the daily puzzle in 3-4 guesses on average (comparable to human performance). The system features strategic planning, browser automation via Selenium, and persistent memory to refine strategy over time.

**Tech Stack:** Python, Google Agent Development Kit (ADK), Selenium

## 2. Agentic Git Assistance (Pacer)
**Date:** Oct 2025
**Type:** UCL AgentVerse Hackathon (1st Place - Narrative Track)
**Summary:** A git-aware multi-agent system that helps developers organize work and actively avoid merge conflicts. The system breaks down user stories, delegates tasks based on developer skills and history, prepares branches, monitors for conflicts, and sends Slack notifications.

**Tech Stack:** Python, LangGraph, Slack

## 3. Multi-Agent Observability Platform (Tracer)
**Date:** Nov 2025
**Type:** Holistic AI Great Agent Hack
**Summary:** A general-purpose multi-agent vacation planner with an advanced observability platform. Key innovations include hallucination prevention using semantic entropy, a model router for optimal model selection, visual agent runtime mapping using trace data, and a RAG-query system for exploring traces with natural language.

**Tech Stack:** Python, LangChain, LangSmith

## 4. Markus AI Sidekick
**Date:** Jan 2026
**Type:** Personal Project
**Summary:** A local AI chatbot running on Ollama (open-source model on a Mac mini) that serves as a website assistant. Markus greets visitors, provides information about Brandon and his projects, and showcases local inference via Cloudflare tunnel with managed context engineering and semantic document grounding.

**Tech Stack:** TypeScript, Ollama

## Common Themes

All of Brandon's projects focus on:
- Agentic AI systems and multi-agent orchestration
- Practical applications of LLMs with tool use and integrations
- Innovation in areas like observability, context management, and efficiency
- Building reliable, scalable AI solutions
